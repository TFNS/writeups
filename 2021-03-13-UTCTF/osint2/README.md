## Description

```
Find the origins of the linked file found in part 1.
```

## Task analysis

We start-off where we finished previous task, at https://twitter.com/ColdwaterWade and we assume we need to find the origin of image https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nhmAthcCUWZ-9ekD20nvVdlannsMPYlb/view

## Solution

We simply drop this image into Google Reverse Image Search and it tells us the image comes from https://tobiasmaier.blogspot.com/2021/03/blog-post_6.html and we get flag `utflag{r3v3rs3d_t0_0r1g1nal}`
