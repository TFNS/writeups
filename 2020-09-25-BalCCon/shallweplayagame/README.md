# shallweplayagame - BalCCon2k20 CTF (rev, 476p, 8 solved)
## Introduction

shallweplayagame is a reversing task.

A Linux ELF file is provided. This program asks for a choice among a list of 5
games inspired from the movie *Wargames*. Every response causes the program to
answer `The only winning move is not to play.`.

## Reverse engineering

Importing the binary in Ghidra shows a simple main function that calls 3
functions. Each of those contain a different check and exit if this check did
not pass.

Debugging the binary shows a different message : `Mess with the best, die like
the rest.`, hinting an anti-debug mechanism.

### Bypass anti-debugs

The most basic way to prevent a program from being debugged on Linux is the
`ptrace` syscall. A program can only be attached by one debugger. As a result,
calls to `ptrace` with request `PTRACE_TRACEME` will fail if a binary is already
debugged.

gdb can be configured to break when a syscall is executed :
```
(gdb) catch syscall ptrace
Catchpoint 1 (syscall 'ptrace' [101])

(gdb) r
Starting program: ./shallweplayagame

Catchpoint 2 (call to syscall ptrace), 0x00000001000014ad in ?? ()
=> 0x00000001000014ad:	48 89 44 24 10	mov    QWORD PTR [rsp+0x10],rax
(gdb) set $rax = 0
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Catchpoint 2 (returned from syscall ptrace), 0x00000001000014ad in ?? ()
=> 0x00000001000014ad:	48 89 44 24 10	mov    QWORD PTR [rsp+0x10],rax
(gdb) set $rax = 0
(gdb) c
Continuing.

YOUR CHOICE [1-5]:
Program terminated with signal SIGALRM, Alarm clock.
The program no longer exists.
```

This works, but the program is quickly killed by `SIGARLM`. gdb can also ignore
certain signals :
```
(gdb) handle SIGALRM ignore
Signal        Stop	Print	Pass to program	Description
SIGALRM       No	No	No		Alarm clock
```

### First check

The first function prints the menu with the 5 games.

The condition here is quite simple : the user's input multiplied by `42` must be
equal to `1316154`.

```assembler
// sscanf(buffer, "%d", &choice);
LEA  RAX, [RSP + 0x0C]
MOV  RDX, RAX
LEA  RSI, "%d"
LEA  RDI, [0x46c0]
MOV  EAX, 0x0
CALL __isoc99_sscanf

// if(choice * 0x2A == 0x14153A)
MOV  EAX, dword ptr [RSP + 0x0C]
IMUL EAX, EAX, 0x2a
CMP  EAX, 0x14153a
JNZ  LAB_00001cda
```

The number to pass the first check is `31337`.

OK....
Well done!
```

## Second check

The second function xors a buffer of size 32 and read the user's input. It then
checks the user's input with this buffer using `strncmp`.

Setting a breakpoint on `strncmp` will show what the expected input is :
```
(gdb) b *0x100000000 + 0x00001ac4
Breakpoint 2 at 0x100001ac4

(gdb) c
Continuing.
test

Breakpoint 2, 0x0000000100001ac4 in ?? ()
=> 0x0000000100001ac4:	e8 a7 f5 ff ff	call   0x100001070

(gdb) x/s $rdi
0x1000046c0:	"test"

(gdb) x/s $rsi
0x100004120:	"Are you, like, a crazy person?"
```

The passphrase to pass the second check is `Are you, like, a crazy person?`


## Third check

The last function calls `strlen` on a buffer located at `0x4740`. This buffer is
a priori never written to and therefore empty. Using a breakpoint shows that
this assumption is true.

```
(gdb) x/s 0x100000000 + 0x4740
0x100004740:	""
```

It then computes the MD5 hash of this buffer of size 0 and passes the result to
a function generated dynamically :
```assembler
   0x7ffff7fc9000:	push   rbp
   0x7ffff7fc9001:	mov    rbp,rsp
   0x7ffff7fc9004:	sub    rsp,0x20
   0x7ffff7fc9008:	mov    rax,0x10
   0x7ffff7fc900f:	mov    rcx,rdi
   0x7ffff7fc9012:	lea    rdx,[rip+0x72]        # 0x7ffff7fc908b
   0x7ffff7fc9019:	dec    rax
   0x7ffff7fc901c:	mov    r8b,BYTE PTR [rcx+rax*1]
   0x7ffff7fc9020:	mov    r9b,BYTE PTR [rdx+rax*1]
   0x7ffff7fc9024:	xor    r8b,r9b
   0x7ffff7fc9027:	jne    0x7ffff7fc9040
   0x7ffff7fc9029:	dec    rax
   0x7ffff7fc902c:	jne    0x7ffff7fc901c
   0x7ffff7fc902e:	mov    r8b,BYTE PTR [rcx+rax*1]
   0x7ffff7fc9032:	mov    r9b,BYTE PTR [rdx+rax*1]
   0x7ffff7fc9036:	xor    r8b,r9b
   0x7ffff7fc9039:	jne    0x7ffff7fc9040
   0x7ffff7fc903b:	xor    rax,rax
   0x7ffff7fc903e:	leave  
   0x7ffff7fc903f:	ret    

   // write(STDOUT_FILENO, "UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED\n", 0x1c);
   0x7ffff7fc9040:	mov    rax,0x1
   0x7ffff7fc9047:	mov    rdi,0x1
   0x7ffff7fc904e:	lea    rsi,[rip+0x19]        # 0x7ffff7fc906e
   0x7ffff7fc9055:	mov    rdx,0x1c
   0x7ffff7fc905c:	syscall 

   // exit(1);
   0x7ffff7fc905e:	mov    rax,0x3c
   0x7ffff7fc9065:	mov    rdi,0x1
   0x7ffff7fc906c:	syscall 
```

This function checks the hashes with a buffer located at `0x7ffff7fc908b`.
```
(gdb) x/16bz 0x7ffff7fc908b
0x7ffff7fc908b:	0xc9	0xf4	0x1e	0x6d	0x2b	0x50	0x32	0x16
0x7ffff7fc9093:	0xe7	0x72	0xb8	0xe5	0xfd	0x00	0xad	0xfe
```

This buffer contains `c9f41e6d2b503216e772b8e5fd00adfe`, which is the MD5 hash
for `JOSHUA`.

Given that this program contained anti debug code that runs ptrace, it means
there has to be code run before main. In other words : constructors.

There are 5 constructors. The 4th one (`_INIT_3`) contains code that opens a
file, and read its content in a buffer located at `0x4740`.  The name of this
file is `lic`.

The file to pass the third check is called `lic` and should contain `JOSHUA`.

```sh
$ echo -n JOSHUA > lic
$ ./shallweplayagame
