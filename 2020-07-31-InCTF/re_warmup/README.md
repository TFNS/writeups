# Warmup (re, 600p, 31 solved)

## Description

In the task we get [ELF binary](warmup).
It's pretty large and statically compiled, but by looking at `strings` we immediately notice that (ironically) it's `strings`!
We suspect that there is some added secret functionality and we need to locate this patch.

## Analysis

Initially we thought about something like Diaphora or just bindiff, but for statically compiled binary this could be rather hard to do.

Fortunately we quickly noticed one strange quirk - the usage was providing description for the parameters, as it normally should!
From this clue we looked at available parameters in the binary -> `adfhzHn:wot:e:T:s:Vv0123456789`

If we compare this with original strings binary, you will notice there is a special `z` parameter which normally is not present.

We can now follow this thread and see what exactly does this parameter do.
Sadly ghidra didn't like the `switch` expression which parses the parameters, so we switched to gdb for a moment, just to follow the switch, and we hit:

```
004010a8 MOV dword ptr [magic_flag ],0x1
```

So we know that special parameter sets this flag to 1.
Now we follow x-refs to this flag, to see where it's used.
There is only one function at `0x00400e10`.

This code reads input file, allocates memory and eventually we arrive at:

```c
  index = 0;
  do {
    allocated_buffer[index] =
         ((file_content[index] ^ (byte)index) + 0x41) - (char)(0x42 % (long)((int)index + 1));
    index = index + 1;
  } while ((ulong)(iVar3 - 1) + 1 != index);


  cVar2 = *allocated_buffer;
  lVar5 = 0x2d;
  pointer_to_consts = &some_consts;
  pcVar6 = acStack72;
  while (lVar5 != 0) {
    lVar5 = lVar5 + -1;
    *pcVar6 = *pointer_to_consts;
    pointer_to_consts = pointer_to_consts + (ulong)bVar7 * -2 + 1;
    pcVar6 = pcVar6 + (ulong)bVar7 * -2 + 1;
  }
  

  if (cVar2 == -0x56) {
    lVar5 = 1;
    do {
      if (lVar5 == index) goto LAB_00400f06;
      pcVar6 = allocated_buffer + lVar5;
      pcVar1 = acStack72 + lVar5;
      lVar5 = lVar5 + 1;
    } while (*pcVar6 == *pcVar1);
  }
```

- First part is clearly some encryption/decryption process on the input file.
- Second part is just `strcpy` of some constant values to the stack buffer.
- Third part is just `strcmp` of input file encryption/decryption result with the loaded stack buffer

## Solution

We want now to simply invert the logic -> get the constants and apply inverse of the encryption operation to, hopefully, recover the flag:

```python
def main():
    data = [0xAA, 0xB0, 0xA2, 0xB6, 0xA2, 0x91, 0x71, 0xB1, 0xA7, 0x80, 0x96, 0x97, 0x78, 0xB6, 0x9E, 0x99, 0x72, 0x97, 0x85, 0x98, 0x8F, 0x91, 0x7F, 0x77,
            0x7C, 0x80, 0x9D, 0x61, 0xAB, 0x95, 0x8A, 0x7F, 0xB4, 0x8F, 0x9F, 0x35, 0x9F, 0x87, 0x8D, 0x98, 0x95, 0x9F, 0x8D, 0xAA]
    result = ''
    for i, d in enumerate(data):
        result += chr((d + 0x42 % (i + 1) - 0x41) ^ i)
    print(result)


main()
```

And we get: `inctfU5uaL_W4rmUPs_NEED_STr1nGS_SO_1_GAVE_IT`
